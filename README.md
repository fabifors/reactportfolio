# Welcome to my Portfolio repo
Hi, Fabian here. This is my first project in react. As an assignment in school I will build a react app that represent my passed and future work. The app will consist of a single page to start and maybe gets more pages added on later if I so choose. 

The goal of this project is to develop base understanding of react and it's methods for rendering component based applications to the web.

## Component Tree
{Input component tree here}

## Key points
This site will display my current level of skills from 0-100 in my own scale using my own library to render a react skillbar component. I will also include some information about me, how I write code and short descriptions of why I do it. I will also include a portfolio section where I list my work so far. 

## Libraries used
I will use all of the below stated libraries to style and animate components or to simply enchance the development experience. 

### `Styled Components` 
https://www.styled-components.com/

Library used to style components. This really is the future!


## Available Scripts

Of course all the avaliable scripts from create-react-app are avaliable here aswell. I have shortend this version to only include `npm i` and `npm start` since these are the only script you really need to use to test the application. The intent of this project is only to develop my skills and has no need for collaborations. 

>Thanks for downloading and taking an interest in my personal development into the world of the web.

First of all run:

### `npm i`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
