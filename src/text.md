##Hero
I am a Front-End Developer student with an emphasis on design. Together we can make your project stand out!

##About
Currently, I a student learning Front-End Development at KYH in Stockholm. Prior to this, I have worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build websites for my friends and family. I have designed both websites and assets. Being interested in both coding and design gives me a deeper understanding of how everything comes together. It also makes me create and develop other designers mockups to perfection.

##Skills

I believe that great design inspires creativity. Because of this, I aim to create modern, simplistic designs that inspire people. Every project can be very different yet they all start with an Idea born out of creativity and ends with development. Using and developing my skills are essential to how I approach my projects.
